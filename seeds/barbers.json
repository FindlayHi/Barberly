    "bio": "Cory came on as an apprentice in the summer of 2014. Dedication is not the word to explain what he showed. He worked hard to get to where he is and now he eats, sleeps and breathes barbering. Sit with Cory and sometimes you actually forget your hair is being cut. It's an experience when you sit with him."
